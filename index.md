Welcome to our special edition magazine that explores the history of crime in San Francisco from 2002 to 2017. San Francisco has long been known for its vibrant culture, stunning views, and progressive values. However, it has also faced its share of challenges, including a significant rise in crime during the early 2000s.

During this period, San Francisco experienced a range of criminal activity, from petty theft to violent crimes. Despite various efforts by the city authorities to address the issue, crime rates continued to climb, affecting the safety and well-being of the residents.

In this magazine, we take a closer look at the key factors that contributed to the rise in crime during this period, as well as the strategies and measures that were implemented to combat it. We also examine some of the most high-profile cases that occurred during this time, including the infamous "Zodiac Killer" case, and explore how these incidents impacted the city and its residents.

Join us as we delve into the complex and often difficult history of crime in San Francisco, and gain a deeper understanding of the city's past and its ongoing efforts to create a safer community for all.

As you can see on the map below, if you are going to park your car, Tenderloin is the best district where you can do so, while you should try to avoid areas such as Mission and Bayview, since most of the cases occur there.

You should also be extra careful during late nights to be attentive to how long will you leave your car alone, since most of the car theft happens during the afternoon. Below, you can find a graph that shows when do the majority of the cases take place, which you can see that during the night and morning the cases are reduced in comparison to the night.

While you are in San Francisco, you should not only try to be careful about where do you park your car, but also be careful about yourself and where do you walk and turist. Since 2005, the number of car theft cases has remained constant, but the larceny cases has only increased. This number keeps increasing and by 2016 the annual years has been over 40,000 cases!
