This city is well know for the their culture, night life, landscapes and much more! Thanks to this, this city calls millions of people every year but, unfortunately this not always mean good things.

San Francisco has been facing an increment in criminality in the past years and, today, we will focus on the police reports from 2002 to 2017.

As you can see on the map below, if you are going to park your car, Tenderloin is the best district where you can do so, while you should try to avoid areas such as Mission and Bayview, since most of the cases occur there.

You should also be extra careful during late nights to be attentive to how long will you leave your car alone, since most of the car theft happens during the afternoon. Below, you can find a graph that shows when do the majority of the cases take place, which you can see that during the night and morning the cases are reduced in comparison to the night.

While you are in San Francisco, you should not only try to be careful about where do you park your car, but also be careful about yourself and where do you walk and turist. Since 2005, the number of car theft cases has remained constant, but the larceny cases has only increased. This number keeps increasing and by 2016 the annual years has been over 40,000 cases!
