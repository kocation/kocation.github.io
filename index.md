Welcome to this week's edition of Life in California. Today, we will talk about San Francisco, the centre of California's society. This city is well know for the their culture, night life, landscapes and much more! Thanks to this, this city calls millions of people every year but, unfortunately this not always mean good things.

San Francisco has been facing an increment in criminality in the past years and, today, we will focus on the police reports from 2002 to 2017. The city has experienced a wide range of types of crime focuses, some of them are vandalism, narcotics, and theft. This last one is the most common type of crime occuring in San Francisco, which we will explain more in depth along this article. 

If you are planning on a road trip to this city, you must be careful about where will you park your car, since car theft is one of the most common cases reported in San Francisco, here you can have a reference of the most risky places of where you can park your car if you go for a weekend trip:

Car theft is one of the most frustrating experiences one can have as the Vehicle most likely if recovered will no longer be in the condition it was prior to the theft. This makes it crucial to know where the car can be left and where it most likely will attract too much attention. Therefore, to determine the safest District in which a vehicle can be left without having to worry about not finding it where it was parked. The crime data of each vehicle theft in the year 2017 is analyzed to provide a reference on the most recent car thefts. Furthermore, individual days can also be selected to see which days the vehicles were most likely to be stolen in the respective Districts, where green represents safe and scales to a red (unsafe) color.

In the heatmap of the San Francisco area the safest zones can be seen in green and the not so safe zones in Red. An interesting observation of the heat map is that the vehicle will be safest if is parked the entire week in Tenderloin. This district seems to have the least theft records of all the district no matter what day of the week. Another interesting discovery is that the districts such as Northern, Mission and Bayview seem to have the most Vehicle thefts throughout the week. 

This could be since the most crimes that have occurred in San Francisco have usually occurred in the districts Northern, Mission and Southern, which could lead to the assumption that the reputation of these districts does not help the diminution of crime.

Furthermore, if investigating the time of the day in which the vehicle is most likely to be stolen it suggests that the early times in the day are the safest times for a vehicle to be parked in the streets of San Francisco.

Furthermore, when analyzing  the the polar plot it appears that the early morning hours are the safest time to park a car in San Francisco. This could be due to a number of factors.
Firstly, during the early morning hours, there are generally fewer people out and about, which means there may be fewer potential thieves looking for opportunities to steal vehicles. Additionally, the early morning hours are typically associated with people going to work, which means that there may be more police patrols in the area, which could serve as a deterrent to thieves.
Another possible explanation is that many people who steal cars do so in order to use them for other crimes or to sell them for parts. During the early morning hours, it may be more difficult for thieves to do this, as most auto parts stores and chop shops are likely closed, and there may be fewer opportunities to use stolen cars for criminal activities.
It's also possible that the early morning hours are simply when fewer people are parking their cars on the streets of San Francisco, which means that there is less competition for parking spaces and fewer potential targets for thieves.
Overall, while the exact reasons for why it's safest to park a car in San Francisco in the early morning hours are not clear-cut, the crime data suggests that this is the case, and car owners may want to take this into consideration when deciding when and where to park their vehicles in the city.

The data however reveals a fall in vehicle thefts through the years, when comparing it to other theft related crimes. For instance, Stolen Property, Robbery and Burglary all seem to have stayed quite stable with identical incident numbers from 2003 till 2017 a reason for this could the changes in the economic, social, or demographic characteristics of San Francisco which may have offset any increases or decreases in these types of crimes over time. For example, changes in the housing market, gentrification of neighborhoods, or changes in the population demographics may have impacted the prevalence of these types of crime.

In contrast Vehicle Theft has halved within the same time span going from almost 20.000 to under 10.000. On the other side of that spectrum lies Larceny/Theft which has doubled over that span to 50.000 cases, which could be due to the rise of e-commerce and the increase in the use of electronic devices such as smartphones and tablets has led to an increase in the number of thefts of these items. Additionally, the rise in the population of San Francisco and the increasing number of tourists and visitors to the city may have contributed to an increase in the number of thefts. In contrast, vehicle thefts are a more specific type of theft and may be affected by factors such as technological advancements of anti-theft technology systems in vehicles and perhaps the law enforcement of San Francisco having implemented more effective strategies to prevent vehicle thefts, such as increasing the number of police patrols, using advanced technology to track stolen vehicles, and implementing community outreach programs to educate residents about vehicle theft prevention. It's also possible that changes in the economic, social, or demographic characteristics of San Francisco have played a role in reducing vehicle thefts over time.
